# Contributing to GreenPiThumb

## Automated Build Checks

PRs to GreenPiThumb must pass the project's automated build checks in Travis CI.
To run these checks on your system locally before each commit, run the
[`enable_hooks` script](https://github.com/JeetShetty/GreenPiThumb/blob/master/hooks/enable_hooks).

## Code Style

GreenPiThumb follows the conventions of the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

## Unit Tests

It's easier for us to accept PRs if the developer implements unit tests to
exercise the changes. Please review GreenPiThumb's [existing unit tests](https://github.com/JeetShetty/GreenPiThumb/tree/master/tests)
to get a sense of how to write unit tests consistent with the project.
